In order to manage the transfer of material and energy in the brewing process, individual components within the brewing system, as well holistic function of the brewery environment have been adapted to maximize efficiency. Knowledge of the specific design and operation of these components within the overall system is crucial to the proper functioning of a brewery. The operation of individual components and processes within the brewery will be examined in terms of the physics and engineering principles driving their function. On completion, this course will provide sufficient knowledge of brewery equipment and operations to function successfully in an entry to mid-level position.",

Basic skills to be mastered include the use of volumetric equipment, spectrophotometers, chromatography, and electrophoresis. You will also learn to assay small quantities of biological materials and analyze lab data. You will learn to manipulate biochemical materials from three of the four major subgroups: proteins, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. You will determine structural elements at a number of analytical levels and learn how to think about their functional capabilities. We will emphasize theoretical information, while discussing how the techniques work. The explanations discuss how the techniques work. We focus on how consecutive methods are interconnected to form process chains.",

This comprises different molecular approaches for gene cloning, bacterial selection/screening and regulation of genetic expression. The course provides hands-on experience during laboratory sessions, where students isolate a gene of interest, clone the gene into an expression vector, transform bacteria, select for positive clones, grow recombinant cells, and induce the production of the protein of interest. Techniques such as SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and ELISA are used for the detection and quantification of the active recombinant protein.",

Students will become confident in reading and analyzing scientific literature, communicating scientific principles, compiling a poster presentation, presenting at scientific conferences, and attending local scientific symposia as well as practicing some basic laboratory techniques. The 2-semester Research PackTrack Program [BIO 267 and 269] is designed to prepare undergraduates for an original research experience in a scientific laboratory. A B- or better in BIO 267 is required to take BIO 269. Students in BIO 267 are required to attending one research symposium outside of regular class time. Individualized/Independent Study and Research courses require a Course Agreement for Students Enrolled in Non-Standard Courses be completed by the student and faculty member prior to registration by the department.",

We'll examine what happens to various systems in the body when the stress response occurs and doesn't shut down. Among the systems explored will be neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, digestive, immune, and reproductive. We'll also look at how stress affects sleep, depression, prenatal and childhood development, and memory and judgment.

It is open to students in all majors who want to deepen and broaden their understanding of how citizens make sense of science and technology in their everyday lives. The course features a mixture of theory-based readings and discussion with practical skill-building for communication in real-world contexts. Equal emphasis is given to humanities and social science perspectives. The application of communication concepts to controversial science contexts is emphasized, including case studies of issues such as GMOs, climate change, vaccines, and gene editing. Theoretical perspectives covered include argumentation and debate; audience analysis [through quantitative survey data and metrics]; philosophy and ethics of communicating science; using narratives, framing, and metaphors to communicate science; and the cultural image of science in popular media.",

Also, being a fairly low-level language, C lets us see and control more of what's going on in the hardware. This can help us think about using the hardware more effectively, whether we're actually programming in C or in a higher-level language. While we learn C, we'll also learn about tools and techniques that help us build, manage, debug and analyze software projects.",

The first part of the course focuses on photovoltaic science and technology. The characteristics and design of common types of solar cells is discussed, and the known approaches to increasing solar cell efficiency will be introduced. After the review of the physics of solar cells, we will discuss advanced topics and recent progresses in solar cell technology. The second part of the course is focused on thermoelectric effect. The basic physical properties, Seebeck coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivities, are discussed and analyzed through the Boltzmann transport formalism. Advanced subject such as carrier scattering time approximations in relation to dimensionality and the density of states are studied. Different approaches for further increasing efficiencies are discussed including energy filtering, quantum confinement, size effects, band structure engineering, and phonon confinement.",

There are literally thousands of such regulations spread across Federal, State, and local jurisdictions. The Facilities Engineer must, from an engineering perspective, know how to identify and comply with these regulations. Environmental compliance may very well be the only aspect of engineering where an individual can incur both civil and criminal liability for violation of these laws. This course will teach the student the gamut of environmental regulations across the engineering disciplines.",

Beginning with the colonial-era European production and consumption of tobacco, chocolate and precious metals and moving through 19th-century industrialization, world's fairs, 20th-century food, drink and film industries and the impact of late 20th-century neoliberal trade policies and tourism, we will explore the impact of external economic exploitation in Latin American contexts through a variety of texts, films, historic and contemporary publicity campaigns and cultural representations.",

Emphasis on efficiency, flexibility and sanitation has led to equipment and controls which have vastly improved the volume and consistency of brewery output while also improving safety and the quality of the working environment. In order to manage the transfer of material and energy in the brewing process, individual components within the brewing system, as well holistic function of the brewery environment have been adapted to maximize efficiency. Knowledge of the specific design and operation of these components within the overall system is crucial to the proper functioning of a brewery. The operation of individual components and processes within the brewery will be examined in terms of the physics and engineering principles driving their function. On completion, this course will provide sufficient knowledge of brewery equipment and operations to function successfully in an entry to mid-level position.",

Topics may include imprinting, mechanisms driving epigenetic modifications, how environmental exposures may influence your grandchildren's health, why identical twins exhibit differences in behavior or disease susceptibility, and epigenetic and environmental bases of diverse diseases. We will also discuss experimental strategies for studying epigenetics. JR standing.",

In addition to exposure to new diseases the complexities of politics and global relations often create opportunities for the re-emergence of infections that were once thought to be under control. This course aims to provide students interested in the health sciences with a foundation to understand the principles governing emergence of diseases.",

After the review of the physics of solar cells, we will discuss advanced topics and recent progresses in solar cell technology. The second part of the course is focused on thermoelectric effect. The basic physical properties, Seebeck coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivities, are discussed and analyzed through the Boltzmann transport formalism. Advanced subject such as carrier scattering time approximations in relation to dimensionality and the density of states are studied. Different approaches for further increasing efficiencies are discussed including energy filtering, quantum confinement, size effects, band structure engineering, and phonon confinement.",

From this introduction of the governing equations for full kinetic treatment, methods for analyzing plasma response to electromagnetic and electrostatic perturbations using the linearized Vlasov model for uncorrelated plasmas are introduced. Kinetic stability of Vlasov plasmas is introduced and the Nyquist method is used to determine conditions for kinetic stability. The concept of correlated plasmas is then introduced through the introduction of reduced distribution functions and the BBGKY heirarchy. Finally, simple correlated systems and the Liouville model for two-system correlation is covered to look at the impact of particle correlation due to collisions and coulomb interaction.",

Thermal transport, mechanics, and thermomechanics affecting fuel behavior will be introduced, and methods to solve the governing equations numerically and analytically will be developed. Subsequently, changes in the fuel and cladding material that degrade the performance of the fuel will be examined. Finally, the knowledge gained throughout the course will be utilized to conduct fuel performance simulations with MOOSE.",

Students will identify and analyze the interactions between these disciplines in light of increasing population and concentrated agriculture's increased vulnerability to major disruptions in food production. Students will also analyze where potential links in the food chain are susceptible to disruptions by individuals [or natural disasters], the consequences of these disruptions, and how to minimize the associated risks by developing case studies and strategies for defending against specific threats.

From this introduction of the governing equations for full kinetic treatment, methods for analyzing plasma response to electromagnetic and electrostatic perturbations using the linearized Vlasov model for uncorrelated plasmas are introduced. Kinetic stability of Vlasov plasmas is introduced and the Nyquist method is used to determine conditions for kinetic stability. The concept of correlated plasmas is then introduced through the introduction of reduced distribution functions and the BBGKY heirarchy. Finally, simple correlated systems and the Liouville model for two-system correlation is covered to look at the impact of particle correlation due to collisions and coulomb interaction.",

The characteristics and design of common types of solar cells is discussed, and the known approaches to increasing solar cell efficiency will be introduced. After the review of the physics of solar cells, we will discuss advanced topics and recent progresses in solar cell technology. The second part of the course is focused on thermoelectric effect. The basic physical properties, Seebeck coefficient, electrical and thermal conductivities, are discussed and analyzed through the Boltzmann transport formalism. Advanced subject such as carrier scattering time approximations in relation to dimensionality and the density of states are studied. Different approaches for further increasing efficiencies are discussed including energy filtering, quantum confinement, size effects, band structure engineering, and phonon confinement.",

      "description": "This course examines cultural perspectives on science and cultural practices within scientific communities as illuminated through examination of fields of inquiry generally considered outside of mainstream science. We will ask questions that include: How does and should science draw and enforce its boundaries? How is evidence considered within and across diverse scientific disciplines and in social spheres, and how do these realms influence one another? Students will engage with scientifically-framed arguments from so-called \"skeptics,\" \"believers,\" and others, as well as consider issues in and aspects of science including reproducibility, experimental design, statistical analysis, media representations, instrumentation, measurement, citizen science, and history and philosophy of science. By \"thinking and doing\" within these fields, students will develop an embodied sense of how to conduct scientific inquiry and situate scientific thinking within society and life.",

This opportunity will consist of an evolving list of external partners that could additionally include community cat organizations and foster care sheltering networks for any given rotation.",

Most of the patients that you will see have chronic relapsing disease that can be frustrating, and often costly for the owner. Therefore, whilst an accurate diagnosis represents the first step in dealing with a case, the challenge in this field of medicine is to successfully manage cases in the long term. This requires good and open communication with the client as well as regular patient evaluation. Most of the diagnostic techniques employed in dermatology are very simple and do not require expensive equipment or excessive amounts of time. The key to successful dermatological practice is to use these tools appropriately to recognize conditions such as parasitic infestations and bacterial or yeast infections for which there is a specific course of treatment. It specializes in the diagnosis and management of chronic ear disease and immunological dermatoses such as autoimmune skin diseases, food reactions and atopic dermatitis. The good practitioner however, recognizes that cutaneous manifestations may be a reflection of internal disease and a thorough systemic evaluation is also required. When studying the skin there is one big advantage, it is on the outside.",

Private practice experiences are available for year 1 - 3 students through the selective offerings. Presently, senior studentshave the opportunity to experience private practice by arranging an externship as an elective. However, initiating an elective course will ensure consistency between experiences, with clear expectations to achieve an approved level of learning/skills objectives with verification from the practice. Practitioners will be valuable partners in the education process in the senior year, providing access to individual animal and herd-related clinical diversity that is increasingly difficult to offer in the academic setting.",
